# Inkscape Electronic Circuits

This is a personal Inkscape plugin, which draws electronic circuit symbols. It is based on 
[fsmMLK/nkscapeCircuitSymbols](https://github.com/fsmMLK/inkscapeCircuitSymbols).

These symbols are not adhering to any standards, but are mostly European.

# Available symbols

__RLC__

- Resistor
- Capacitor
- Polarized Capacitor
- Inductor
- Potentiometer

## TODO Symbols

__Transistors__

- BJT
  - NPN
  - PNP
  - Phototransistor (NPN and PNP)
- FET
  - MOSFET Enhanced
  - MOSFET Depleted
  - JFET
  - CMOS (MOSFET shorthand notation, I call it CMOS in my brain)

__Diodes__

- Regular
- LED
- Schottky
- Zener

Also voltage, current sources, ground, terminals (signals), transformers, switches (maybe).
